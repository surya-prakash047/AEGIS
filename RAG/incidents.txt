Heavy rainfall across the Mumbai region has caused major waterlogging and traffic disruption. The IMD-issued red alert remained in force for two consecutive days as Mumbai recorded over 250 mm of rain in a 24-hour span, its worst deluge since 2019. Low-lying areas such as Dharavi, Govandi and Mankhurd were under 1–2 feet of water, stranding thousands of commuters and forcing the suburban railway network to suspend services during peak hours. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation mobilized over 500 pumps and dispatched disaster-response teams to evacuate residents; rescue boats ferried families from inundated slum clusters. Hospitals in South Mumbai reported a 30 % spike in emergency calls for water-borne illnesses, while power outages affected more than 200 substations across the city.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 struck near Shillong in northeastern India at 04:30 IST on January 8, 2025, at a shallow depth of 10 km, causing tremors felt as far as Guwahati and Jorhat. Local authorities reported cracks in mud-brick homes across 15 villages in East Khasi Hills, triggering precautionary evacuations of roughly 600 residents. Aftershocks of up to magnitude 4.2 followed within two hours, though none caused additional damage or injuries. Relief teams dispatched from the Shillong Municipal Board set up temporary shelters and distributed food and medical kits to affected households.

A major fire broke out in a chemical factory in Vadodara, Gujarat late Thursday night, originating in a solvent storage unit at the Gujarat Chemicals plant around 22:15 IST. The plant’s automatic sprinkler system failed to contain the flames, so firefighters from five nearby stations used foam-based extinguishers to tackle the high-intensity chemical fire and prevent a toxic gas leak. The operation involved over 100 personnel and 12 fire-tenders. Two contract workers succumbed to smoke inhalation; eight others were hospitalized with burns and have since been discharged. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board launched an investigation into safety lapses, and state officials announced ex gratia payments of INR 200,000 to the victims’ families.

Temperatures in Delhi crossed 47 °C for the third consecutive day on May 10, 2025, with the Safdarjung Observatory recording 47.2 °C, marking Delhi’s hottest day since 2010. The IMD issued a red alert for the next 48 hours. Metro ridership dipped by 15 % as commuters sought to avoid the midday heat; emergency cooling centers were opened in 12 neighborhood parks across the NCR. Between May 8–10, public hospitals logged over 1,200 heat-related admissions, including 230 cases of acute heatstroke; local NGOs distributed over 5,000 liters of oral rehydration solutions to vulnerable communities. Air quality worsened to “poor” levels (AQI > 200) due to pre-monsoon dust and stagnant conditions, exacerbating respiratory issues and prompting advisories for those with asthma and heart conditions.

A sudden burst of heavy rain flooded parts of Bhopal city on May 2, 2025, with a pre-monsoon downpour of 75 mm in two hours submerging Shahpura, Alpana Trisection and Kolar Road. This “yearly crisis,” blamed on encroachments and clogged nullahs, left dozens of streets impassable and stranded parked cars in knee-deep water. Municipal engineers deployed 20 high-capacity pumps and coordinated with disaster-response teams to clear drains; within four hours most water had receded. Residents and local activists have renewed calls for comprehensive pre-monsoon desilting drives and stricter action against illegal construction on natural drainage paths.

BBC NEWS BREAKING: Trump says India & Pakistan agree to ceasefire. After four days of cross-border missile and drone exchanges—including strikes on three Pakistani airbases and retaliation by both militaries—President Trump announced that the two sides had accepted a “full and immediate ceasefire” at 17:00 IST. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice-President JD Vance led the mediation, with support from Saudi Arabia and China, to secure the truce and prevent nuclear escalation. Within hours of the announcement, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed “immediate effect,” while India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri warned of “repeated violations” and demanded Pakistan take corrective measures. Despite the ceasefire, sporadic shelling and mutual accusations persisted along the Line of Control, and the Indus Waters Treaty remained suspended pending diplomatic clarifications. UN Secretary-General António Guterres and other international actors urged both nations to convert the temporary truce into lasting peace through structured dialogue and confidence-building measures.
